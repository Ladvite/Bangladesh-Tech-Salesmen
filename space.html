      <h1 class="titles">The Solar System</h1>
      <p class="depression">&#9A solar system is a group of celestial objects that orbit around a star. The most well-known solar system is
        the one that we live in, which is called the Solar System.<br>&#9Our Solar System consists of the Sun, which is
        the star at the center, and all of the objects that orbit around it, including planets, dwarf planets, moons,
        asteroids, comets, and other objects.<br>&#9The Solar System is composed of the four terrestrial planets:
        Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are relatively small, dense, and rocky, and they are located
        relatively close to the Sun.<br>&#9The four outer planets, known as the gas giants, are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
        and Neptune. These planets are much larger than the terrestrial planets and are composed mostly of gas and
        ice.<br>&#9The Solar System also includes a number of smaller objects, such as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids,
        and comets. The largest dwarf planet is Pluto, which was once considered to be the ninth planet but was later
        reclassified as a dwarf planet. The Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is a barred spiral
        galaxy containing about 400 billion stars.</p>

    <section id="galaxy">
      <h1 class="titles">The Galaxy</h1>
      <p class="depression">&#9A galaxy is a collection of stars, planets, and other objects that are held together by gravitational
        forces. Galaxies come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and they can contain anywhere from a few million to
        several trillion stars.<br>&#9Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is a barred spiral galaxy that is thought to contain
        around 400 billion stars. It is about 100,000 light-years in diameter and is estimated to be about 13.5 billion
        years old.<br>&#9The Milky Way is made up of a number of different components, including a central bulge, a
        disk, and a halo. The central bulge is a spherical region located at the center of the galaxy that contains a
        large concentration of stars. The disk is a flat region that contains the majority of the stars in the galaxy,
        as well as the gas, dust, and other materials that are needed to form new stars. The halo is a region of diffuse
        gas and dark matter that surrounds the disk and extends out to the edges of the galaxy.<br>&#9In addition to
        stars, the Milky Way contains a number of other objects, including planets, asteroids, comets, and black holes.
        It is thought that there may also be a large number of exoplanets, or planets that orbit stars outside of our
        Solar System, within the Milky Way.</p>

    <section id="universe">
      <h1 class="titles">The Universe</h1>
      <p class="depression">&#9The universe is the entirety of all space and time, and everything that exists within it, including all
        matter and energy, galaxies, stars, and planets. It is vast and largely unknown, and scientists and researchers
        are constantly working to learn more about it.<br>&#9There are many different branches of study within
        astrophysics and cosmology that focus on understanding the universe and its properties. These fields use a
        variety of tools and methods, including telescopes, satellites, and particle accelerators, to study the universe
        and gather data about its structure, composition, and evolution.<br>&#9One of the key pieces of information that
        scientists have learned about the universe is that it is expanding. The expansion of the universe was first
        observed by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s, and it has since been confirmed by numerous studies. It is thought that
        the universe began with a massive explosion, known as the Big Bang, about 13.8 billion years ago, and that it
        has been expanding ever since.<br>&#9The universe is also thought to be composed of a number of different
        components, including dark matter and dark energy. These components are still not fully understood, but they are
        thought to make up a significant portion of the universe and to play an important role in its
        evolution.<br>&#9Despite all of the progress that has been made in understanding the universe, there is still
        much that we do not know. Researchers continue to study the universe in order to learn more about its origins,
        its structure, and the laws that govern its behavior.</p>
